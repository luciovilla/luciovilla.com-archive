This week marks the 3rd year I have been here in Chicago and I can't believe how much I have been able to accomplish here. I am the News Applications Developer at Hoy Chicago, member of Latino Techies, Board Member of NAHJ Chicago, Migrahack mentor, LatinoCon 2015 speaker, NICAR 2015 speaker, co-founder of Code Latino, helped organize Latino Hackathon and take photos every once in a while.

Photography brought me here to Chicago in the summer of 2012. I drove here with my friends William and Johnny from California and it was only suppose to be a three month internship at the Chicago Reporter.

I was supposed to drive back home. I stayed.

After the summer internship, I was offered to stay for nine more monhts as a photojournalism fellow at The Chicago Reporter. During my fellowship I hustled *con ganas* and was able sustain myself with freelance photography work.

I worked for EFE, Chicago Tribune, The Weather Channel, Chicago Catalyst...

Next week will mark my first year working as a News Applicatons Developer at Hoy Chicago. Now, how did a photographer get this job?

Before I changed my major in college to photojournalism, I was studying Comptuer Science. Back in high school I was developing websites for competitions in the MESA (Mathematics Engineering Science Achievement) club. I came to school on Saturdays to learn how to code. Growing up in Compton, CA where they did not offer any AP Computer Science or web development courses, I checked out books on HTML, CSS and C++ to learn on my own.

After three years into CS, I switched my major to photojournalism and graduated from CSUF in 2012 with a BA in Photo Communications.

Y ahora, I am giving back to those communities that lack resources for learning about web development and with Latino Techies/Code Latino, I will make a difference.
